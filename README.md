# Computed Styles Regression Test ðŸ“·

VisualRT is flaky...but Computed Styles is steady!
This is playwright based utility module to compare compare computed stylesheets(including psedue elements!) of selected DOM Node's and it's ancestors.

## Usage ðŸ’»

```ts
import { expect, test } from "@playwright/test";
import { captureSnapshot, compareSnapshots } from "cssom-regression-test";

test.describe("~~~", () => {
    test("~~~", async ({ page }) => {
        await page.goto("your page");

        const expectSnapshot = await captureSnapshot(page);

        await page.goto("your page to check");
        const actualSnapshot = await captureSnapshot(page);

        const result = await compareSnapshots(expectSnapshot, actualSnapshot);

        expect(result.isEqual).toBeTruthy();
    })
})
```

snapshot(returned by `captureSnapshot`) is just a serializable object, so you can save it with `fs.writeFile` and restore previous snapshot with `fs.readFile` & `JSON.stringify`.

If you want to watch differences between two snapshots, you can view it via `result.differences`.
